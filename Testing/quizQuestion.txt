analytic evaluations -
	analytic - deterministic modeling
		Advantages: Simplicity, 
		Disadvantages: Static environment 
	queuing model - gets rid of static environment
		adv: working with dynamic work load
		dis: use of assumptions that is reason for creating imprecise results
		the generated mathamatical formulas are complex and sometimes impractical
	simulation -
		1 - build a model of the system
		2 - create work loads randomly
		Adv:
		Dis: treating random numbers; order of the jobs
	implementation - measure ur system beahavior and u pick an algorithm
		adv: no assumptions
		dis: impatience of the user

multi-processor scheduling
	all the processes are the same in structure
	homogenous cpu's
	1- every cpu has its own ready queue
	2- having a shared ready queue
	3- Having a common scheduler

Real time scheduling
	Hard Real time system - decid
